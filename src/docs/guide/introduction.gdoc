The Multiple Datasource Support plugin provides first-class support relations between Grails domain objects that are mapped to different datsources using the Grails 2.0 multiple datasource configuration.

The plugin provides an AST Transformation that inserts the necessary field and methods to a domain class to lookup a related object through GORM allowing for that object to exist in a different data source.
